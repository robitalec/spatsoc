Description: Detects spatial and temporal groups in GPS relocations. 
    It can be used to convert GPS relocations to 
    gambit-of-the-group format to build proximity-based social networks. 
    In addition, the randomizations function provides data-stream 
    randomization methods suitable for GPS data.
